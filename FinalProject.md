# Final Project  
## Part 1  
### Project Outline    
Staying hydrated and energized is key to staying healthy—water fuels everything from digestion to keeping us awake during those afternoon slumps. Yet, in the U.S., many of us seem to prefer quenching our thirst with sugary drinks instead.Sure, they taste great, but they're also sneaky little contributors to obesity and type 2 diabetes. By opting for water or healthier alternatives, we can dodge those health risks and stay hydrated without the sugar overload. Remember, small, smart swaps today might just lead to a more energized—and less sugar-crashed—tomorrow!  

#### The Core Concept   
We all know the drill—when we need a quick energy boost, we often grab a juice, soda, or maybe even an energy drink to power through the day. These are the go-to drinks that make us feel instantly satisfied. But here's the catch: they can easily sneak in more sugar than we bargained for, leading to unwanted side effects like obesity and diabetes. This project uses data visualizations to show just how much sugar we're sipping on, and the not-so-sweet impact it has on our health. Plus, it busts a few myths about so-called "healthier" sugar alternatives—because not all that glitters is stevia!  

### Project Structure  
#### Setup: 
This section focuses on understanding the consumption pattern of soft drinks and at the same time understand how much sugar content these beverages have.
1) Momentary Satisfaction: This will highlight how soft drinks are most satisfying beverages reported by US consumers. Additionally, it will show the daily consumption pattern for adults and children in USA.    
2) Sugar Content: This section will showcase some stats about how much sugar these beverages have and how much is actually 

#### Conflict:
This section focuses on showing the consequences of consuming excess sugar and its impact on longterm health. 
1) Daily Sugar Intake: This section will highlight the contrast between daily requirement vs average amount of sugar consumed daily by adults in USA. This will be done by using statistics and data visualization.  
2) Consequences: This section will show obesity and type 2 diabetese death rate in USA, and focus on connecting sugar content with these health problems.

#### Resolution:  
1) Compounding effect: This section focuses on showing the compunding effect of consuming less sugar or gradually cutting down excess sugar from one's diet.  
2) Suggestive Changes: This section will also suggest alternatives and their recommended dosage.
