# Wireframes / storyboards
> I used a 2 staged approach to build wireframes and storyboard. To understand the detailed flow of the story I focused on story flow and asked 3 people in the age group (25-30yrs). Here the focus was understanding the slide by slide detailed story flow before creating Hi-Fidelity draft. Once the flow was set, I used Figma and Shorthand in combination to create the Hi-Fidelity storyboard draft.

User feedback on story flow:
| Questions               | Interview 1  | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| How do you feel about the overall flow of the story? | Overall flow of the story is clear. However, slide 6 seems unecessary. Instead bring slide 8 inplace of slide 6.| In the beginning of the story there isn't much clarity about the target audience. May be you can include the demographic or country specific informatio in slide 5. Additionally, slide 5 should be swaped with slide 4.| I really like the way the narration is working, I believe the jawdrop moment is slide 8, it should come early in the presentation, and may be add some visuals to communicate the idea better. |
|||||
| What do you think about CTAs?| I believe you should focus on suggesting alternatives in CTAs instead of telling safe sugar limits.| For CTAs rightnow you are saying how much sugar is safe, but may be what you need to do is add how much impact it can have say if you use health alternatives.| Just suggest alternatives. That would be helpful.|

Based on this feedback I decided to do following:
1) Delete existing slide 6 and swap it with slide 8. The reason for doing so, was I haven't drawn comparison with water anywhere and all of sudden having water was confusing for users.
2) The CTA suggestions were quite helpful, I decided to go ahead with adding healthy alternatives for the drinks.

# User research 

## Target audience
> The target audience for this research are mid-aged adults who are mature and are between (age 25-50). As the body transitions in this age people are more prone to sedentary life and the risk of diabetese. This is the reason I chose to have these set of people as audience. For the research purpose, I interviewed people between age 25-35 who are graduate students or working full-time, who are busy with their daily work or academic lives. The 3 interviews shed light on what can be further improved in the storyboard. 


## Interview script
> After showcasing the storyboard to the audience ask the following questions to understand their view points.

| Questions               | Interview 1  | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Were there any parts where you were confused? | -Not really confused. But it took some time to understand 1 drink = 3 people's sugar slide. </br> -May be you can add a small description or graphics for the CTA aswell. | -Nothing in particular, but the initial slides have same image so they are getting repetitive. </br> Can you add images for CTA instead of just links? It will help me understand better.| -Everything was seamless, but the softdrinks visual takes a bit of time to read while scrolling.|
| What stood out the most to you in this entire story? | -1 drink=3 people's sugar, that was quite shocking, wasn't aware of that before.| -Two things stood out: </br>  66% of americans drink one soda a day.  </br> 1 drink=3 people's sugar, that was a nice hook. |  For me the amount of sugar in in different drinks was quite informative, it gave me an idea of how much I should consume if at all I have to.|
