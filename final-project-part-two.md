# Wireframes / storyboards
> I used a 2 staged approach to build wireframes and storyboard. To understand the detailed flow of the story I focused on rough sketches and asked 3 people in the age group (25-30yrs). Here the focus was understanding the slide by slide detailed story flow before creating Hi-Fidelity draft. Once the flow was set, I used Figma and Shorthand in combination to create the Hi-Fidelity storyboard draft.

User feedback on sketch draft:
| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| How do you feel about the overall flow of the story? | Insightful feedback            |             |             |
|                         |                                |             |             |
|                         |                                |             |             |
