# Wireframes / storyboards
> I used a 2 staged approach to build wireframes and storyboard. To understand the detailed flow of the story I focused on story flow and asked 3 people in the age group (25-30yrs). Here the focus was understanding the slide by slide detailed story flow before creating Hi-Fidelity draft. Once the flow was set, I used Figma and Shorthand in combination to create the Hi-Fidelity storyboard draft.

User feedback on story flow:

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>How do you feel about the overall flow of the story?</td>
      <td>Overall flow of the story is clear. However, slide 6 seems unnecessary. Instead, bring slide 8 in place of slide 6.</td>
      <td>In the beginning of the story, there isn't much clarity about the target audience. Maybe you can include demographic or country-specific information in slide 5. Additionally, slide 5 should be swapped with slide 4.</td>
      <td>I really like the way the narration is working. I believe the jaw-drop moment is slide 8, which should come earlier in the presentation. Maybe add some visuals to communicate the idea better.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What do you think about CTAs?</td>
      <td>I believe you should focus on suggesting alternatives in CTAs instead of telling safe sugar limits.</td>
      <td>For CTAs, right now you're saying how much sugar is safe, but maybe add how much impact it can have if you use healthier alternatives.</td>
      <td>Just suggest alternatives. That would be helpful.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



Based on this feedback I decided to do following:
1) Delete existing slide 6 and swap it with slide 8. The reason for doing so, was I haven't drawn comparison with water anywhere and all of sudden having water was confusing for users.
2) The CTA suggestions were quite helpful, I decided to go ahead with adding healthy alternatives for the drinks.

# User research 

## Target audience
> The target audience for this research are mid-aged adults who are mature and are between (age 25-50). As the body transitions in this age people are more prone to sedentary life and the risk of diabetese. This is the reason I chose to have these set of people as audience. For the research purpose, I interviewed people between age 25-35 who are graduate students or working full-time, who are busy with their daily work or academic lives. The 3 interviews shed light on what can be further improved in the storyboard. 


## Interview script
> After showcasing the storyboard to the audience ask the following questions to understand their view points. 



| Goal                                     | Questions to Ask                                                                   |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| To understand the flow of the story      | Were there any parts where you were confused?                                       |
| To understand the highlighting moments   | What stood out most to you in this entire story?                                    |
| To understand how the data visualizations are working | What are your views on the data visualizations? What did you understand?            |
| Additional comments                      | Do you have anything more to add?                                                  |



## Interview findings


| Questions               | Interview 1  | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Were there any parts where you were confused? | -Not really confused. But it took some time to understand 1 drink = 3 people's sugar slide. </br> -May be you can add a small description or graphics for the CTA aswell. | -Nothing in particular, but the initial slides have same image so they are getting repetitive. </br> Can you add images for CTA instead of just links? It will help me understand better.| -Everything was seamless, but the softdrinks visual takes a bit of time to read while scrolling.|
| What stood out the most to you in this entire story? | -1 drink=3 people's sugar, that was quite shocking, wasn't aware of that before.| -Two things stood out: </br>  66% of americans drink one soda a day.  </br> 1 drink=3 people's sugar, that was a nice hook. |  For me the amount of sugar in in different drinks was quite informative, it gave me an idea of how much I should consume if at all I have to.|  

The answers of the questions 3 was covered in the above question, so didn't have to probe users for separate answers.

# Identified changes for Part III


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| There were 3 main findings: <br> 1) Amount of sugar in soft drinks visualization was taking some time to read through. Which is not necessarily bad but can be made better in the final version. <br> 2) Images for the CTA is a nice suggestion instead of just links, can give users better context. <br> 3) For the initial slides in the final version, the image should either change or remain static in the background to avoid scrolling confusion. | - Improve the data visualizations to match the overall theme and make it simpler. <br> - Adjust the initial 3 slides to build more context and alleviate scrolling confusion. <br> - Try experimenting with visuals for 1 drink = 3 people's sugar. <br> - Add imagery for CTA and a small description. |



# Moodboards 
> The moodboard here focuses on creating a visual and typographical style that suits the context of softdrinks.
