# Infection Awareness  
For this project an existing data-visualization about antibiotics awareness among Americans in 2019, was chosen. The original data-visulaization looks fairly simple, but is difficult to comprehend and builds un-necessary co-relations. This is what intrigued me and motivated me to simplify this graphic. A simple process of Evaluation-Ideation-Finalization was followed to reach the end output. During the process some user feedback was collected to guage how user's are viewing the new graphic.

### Original Data-Visualization

### 1) EVALUATION: Analyzing original data-visualization  
#### First Impressions
Firstly I can see a stacked bar graph with % values. Then my attention is drawn to KFF. I quickly focus on the light blue bars and then see the title to build context. Further I move towards the legend and then spend some time figuring out the text on the left.  

#### Who could be the potential user for such data?
This data visualization is primarily intended for government agencies and healthcare institutions. It provides a solid demographic overview of public awareness regarding antibiotics. Government agencies can use this demographic data to inform their healthcare awareness campaigns, while medical institutions can gain insights into psychological patterns and public sentiment surrounding viruses and antibiotics. This information can be particularly valuable in shaping care delivery policies and drug awareness initiatives.

#### Initial Observations
After spending a couple of minutes, now I start understanding that the labels on the left display demographic information. It is still difficult to understand the region/country this graph represents. A short description below the title suggests that this data is about an experiment or study conducted on awareness about use of antibiotics. While the graph and demographic information on left helps in understanding the bifurcation of people's knowledge, its unclear which attribute is more important.  


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>What I like?</th>
      <th>What I dislike?</th>
      <th>What I wish I saw?</th>
      <th>What I think I would do differently?</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>I like how the labels are in grey and go in the background.</td>
      <td>I don't like the clutter on the left, it's creating confusion and I'm unable to determine which one is more important.</td>
      <td>I wish there was clear distinction and space between each demographic category. this would take away the visual confusion.</td>
      <td>I will add location/region to build more context while viewing this data for the target audience.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I also like how the stacked bar chart is limited to 3 attributes, as it is easy to compare 3 quantities.</td>
      <td>I also dislike how the graph doesn't talk about any specific location or region.</td>
      <td>I wish the title or description had a region to which this demographic population belongs to.</td>
      <td>I will split this chart into 4 distinct graphics or make clear sections to avoid confusion caused due to proximity of bar charts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Having a title, description and legend is really helpful in building context for this chart, so I like that.</td>
      <td>I dislike the confusion created by multiple comparisons. Here there is a comparison that is happening horizontally across 3 colored values and there is a comparison that is happening vertically. This is creating a lack of focus while reading this chart.</td>
      <td>I wish there were separate sub-titles or descriptions for each category to help reader understand what to look for in each section.</td>
      <td>I will add subtitles or description for each section to help user understand what to look for.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>  

### Evaluation criterias and scores on a scale of 10  
#### Usefulness = 7/10  
(Is it useful for the intended audience? Does it communicate valuable information?)  
  
Reason: The graphic displays demographic bifurcation, so it is usesful for government agencies and healthcare institutes. However it doesn't include region or location, which makes it slightly unusable if its not accompanied with supporting text.  

#### Completeness = 6/10  
(Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it understandable?)  
  
Reason: The graphic doesn't have location details, it doesn't show sample size of the audience. Additionally, it lacks subtitles or descriptions for each demographic sector.  

#### Perceptibility = 4/10  
(Can the reader understand the information with minimal effort? Is the visualization type appropriate?  Does it use illogical comparisons?)  
  
Reason: It takes quite a while to understand what is going on within the visualization. Due to the lack of whitespace between the two demographic sections. It leads to illogical vertical comparison.  

#### Truthfulness = 10/10  
(Is the visualization accurate, reliable and valid?  Is it representing what it says it is, and in the most complete and truthful manner? Does it misrepresent the data or make comparisions that aren't correct?)  
  
Reason: The data is represented in truthful manner and there isn't any data which is falsified or represented in wrongful manner.  

#### Intuitiveness = 4/10   
(Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information? If unfamiliar, does it include easy to understand instructions on how to interpret it?)  
  
Reason: The graphic isn't obvious, and it takes a while to understand what's going on. Most importantly there is a struggle to understand what is the focus or larger picture.  

#### Aesthetics = 5/10  
(It is interesting / enjoyable to look at? Is it a good example of what a beautiful data visualization might look like? Is it somewhere in the middle pleasing but otherwise not distracting to look at?)  
  
Reason: The graphic does a fair job in aesthetics. Uses grey to put text in background and use minimal colors. However, it can be better if whitespace is used to convey segregation and  color is used to add meaning.  

#### Engagement = 7/10  
(Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic? Does it inspire the audience to talk about the data or share it with others?)  
  
Reason: The graphic does a fair job in aesthetics. Uses grey to put text in background and use minimal colors. However, it can be better if  whitespace is used to convey segregation and  color is used to add meaning.  

### 2) IDEATION: Exploring various ways to represent the data effectively  
It started with a few scribbles where different versions of bar charts, line cahrts and pie charts were explored to represent the data. All of this resulted in following 2 concepts. The overall idea was to break each demographic into separate charts to alleviate the confusion created in original chart. These concepts were tested with 4 users.

#### Feedback 1:  
*"Compared to original, now I am able to understand which values are important. However, I still don't understand why age and gender is needed? Does it mean, men in 18-64 years are aware of it?"*  

#### Feedback 2:  
*"The heading is relevant, however it leaves me  with the question. Its not giving an overview of the chart. Is the distinction between don't know and wrong answer necessary. It doesn't matter"*

#### Feedback 3:  
*"I definetely like the separate charts. However, I don't agree with red color for correct answer it feels like it is wrong"*

#### Feedback 4:
*"Is age and gender relevant for this type of data. I understand education and income having an impact on antibiotic awareness. Apart from that the separate divergent charts are really working"*

Based on these feedbacks a finalized version was created focusing on income and education as key factors for antibiotics awareness.


### 3) FINAL OUTPUT: The refined output representing the same data

### Overview of the final data-visualization 
For the final data visualization, I focused on income and education as they were the most relevant factors for antibiotic awareness. Additionally, the earlier categories 'usually cure', 'don't know' and 'can't be cured' were defined as follows: 'can't be cured' = aware; 'don't know + usually cured' = unaware. The intent of the graphic was to show how many Americans are aware and unaware, the new categories made it direct. In order to communicate this contrasting categories, I chose divergent chart. Additionally, green color was used to create a focus on awareness. Thus in this way I simplified the original visual to communicate the same data.
