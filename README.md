# Data-Visualization-Portfolio
This is a compilation of all the data visualization projects done in "Telling Stories With Data" at CMU.

## About Me
Hello, I'm Kash a human-centred designer and researcher. I recently worked as an Innovation intern at MD Anderson Cancer Center. In this role I worked on improving patient care experience. 

## What I hope to learn
Throughout my career I've used data to back qualitative research. Through this course I aspire to learn following things:
1. Understanding how to choose best method to communicate varied types of information.
2. How subtle changes can impact how the information is perceived.
3. Work on some projects and get a portfolio piece.
